OOP, or Object Oriented Programming, is one of the major approaches to the software development process. In OOP, developers use objects and classes to structure their code.

In this shopping cart project, I learned how to define classes and use them. I also learned how to create class instances and implement methods for data manipulation, covering concepts like the ternary operator, the spread operator, the this keyword, and more.
